# Ty's `stow`-rage

That's not a great hyphenation, because `stow` actually resolves a lot of dotfile-induced rage.

Here be dotfiles. The program used to manage them, besides `git`, of course, is GNU's [`stow`][stow], which I didn't know about for far too long.

If you're perusing them and don't understand something, I'd probably enjoy explaining it. Note that any comments in shell scripts or other files were probably written for me and might omit some necessary context or other information.
